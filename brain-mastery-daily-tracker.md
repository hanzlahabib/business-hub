## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### If You Miss a Day
Don't beat yourself up. That's the OLD you.
The NEW you gives grace, learns the lesson, and gets back on track immediately.
Missing one day doesn't ruin 90 days. Quitting does.

### If You Feel Overwhelmed
Lower the bar. Make it SO easy you can't fail.
Even 5 minutes of each practice counts.
Something is better than nothing.
Build momentum first, intensity later.

### If You're Not Seeing Results
Trust the process. Compound effect takes time.
Your job: aligned action + becoming a match
Allah's job: timing + delivery
Detach from timeline. Keep showing up.

### If You Want Accountability
- Share your journey with a friend
- Join a community (online or local)
- Post progress on social media
- Find an accountability partner
- Consider working with a coach

## 🤲 Daily Dua

Start each day with this or make your own:

```
Bismillah.

Ya Allah, thank You for this new day.
Thank You for the gift of my brain and ability to grow.
Guide me today to think, speak, and act in ways that please You.
Help me become the person You created me to be.
Give me strength when I'm weak, patience when I'm frustrated,
and gratitude in all circumstances.
I trust Your timing. I trust Your plan.
Ameen.
```

---

**Remember: This is worship. Every practice, every effort, every growth moment is you honoring Allah's creation (you). Do it with love. Do it with joy. Do it with faith.**

**Bismillah, you've got this! 🌙✨**
